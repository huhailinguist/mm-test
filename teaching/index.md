### Useful Resources

_Phonetics and Phonology_:

- Interactive IPA (for you to hear each sound): [link1](http://www.ipachart.com/), [link2](https://web.uvic.ca/ling/resources/ipa/charts/IPAlab/IPAlab.htm)

- [Full IPA chart](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/sites/default/files/IPA_Kiel_2015.pdf). If you see a symbol or diacritic that we didn't cover in class, you can find it here. 

- Natural class: here is a very comprehensive [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IPA-euler-manners-features.svg); another [one](https://allthingslinguistic.com/image/33605639325) just for English.

- [TypeIPA](https://ipa.typeit.org/): You can type IPA symbols by copy-and-paste into your document.

- [tipa](https://jon.dehdari.org/tutorials/tipachart_mod.pdf): If you use Latex, you can use the tipa package.

_Morphology and Syntax_:

- Tool for drawing trees: [line](http://ironcreek.net/syntaxtree/).

- Parser and sentence generator: [here](https://parser.ksteimel.duckdns.org/). Thanks to [Ken](https://ksteimel.duckdns.org/) who built this :)

_Additionally_:

- An excellent website with information on graduate programs, jobs, internships etc. in linguistics: [LINGUIST List](https://linguistlist.org/) 

- FLAS scholarship at IU: [link](https://hls.indiana.edu/student-life/scholarships/flas.html)

> The Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) fellowships are funded by the United States Department of Education in support of graduate and undergraduate students studying less commonly taught languages and cultures, in particular, those considered to be of critical interest to the United States.

_Miscellaneous_:

- Correction is usually futile in first language learning, [example](https://huhailinguist.github.io/teaching/pinker_p285.JPG){:target="_blank"}.
